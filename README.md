# My Health App

## Introduction

As part of my Final Year Project, I have created an app that helps users keep track of their medication and reminds them to take it on time. The app also keeps records of various health-related information. With many people taking medications for different medical purposes or conditions, it is crucial to stay on top of medication schedules. This Flutter-based android app was designed with the vision to assist people in taking their medication on time and keeping track of their health-related records all in one place.

## Features of the application

The application features were created with much thought about what a typical person who takes medication daily might need. The features of the mobile application created are as follows:
- Medicine reminder : The users can add the medicine they take into this application and various detail regarding the medication. The app then sends a push notification to the user every time they need to take the medication.
- Medicine re-stock reminder : While adding the medication detail, the user is also asked for the medication stock they currently have, and when the stock is running low or is finished, the application sends a notification reminding the user to refill their stock or that their stock has run out.
- Notes: The users can also save notes in this application.
- Doctors Information: The users can store basic information about their doctors, such as their contact information. They can contact the doctor form within the application for ease of use
- Health-related measurements: The user can save various health-related measurements such as Blood Pressure, Body Fat, and Pulse in the application.
- Tracker : This feature of the application was made for people with special conditions such as periodic strokes, heart disease, etc. The user can enter a specific interval of time in minutes for the application to track their location in and if the user has not traveled within the entered time frame, it gives an alert to the user asking if they are ok or not and if they pressed no this sends an SMS to the emergency number the user has set up initially asking for their help along with the user location.
- Medicine History: The user can view the medicine they have consumed within the medicine history tab
